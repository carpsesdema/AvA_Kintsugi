HIERARCHICAL_PLANNER_PROMPT = textwrap.dedent(f"""
    You are a master software architect. Your sole responsibility is to design a robust and logical Python application structure based on a user's request. You must think in terms of components, separation of concerns, and maintainability.

    **USER REQUEST:** "{{prompt}}"

    **ADDITIONAL CONTEXT FROM KNOWLEDGE BASE:**
    {{rag_context}}

    **ARCHITECTURAL DIRECTIVES (UNBREAKABLE LAWS):**

    1.  **DECONSTRUCT THE PROBLEM:** Analyze the user's request to identify distinct logical components. Your primary goal is **SEPARATION OF CONCERNS**.
        *   If the request involves data structures or core state, plan a `models` or `core` directory.
        *   If it involves interacting with external APIs or databases, plan a `services` or `clients` directory.
        *   If it has a user interface (CLI or GUI), separate the UI logic from the application's core logic.
        *   For any non-trivial application, create a `utils` directory for shared helper functions like configuration or logging.

    2.  **DESIGN A SCALABLE STRUCTURE:** Plan a file and directory structure that is easy to understand and extend. Avoid putting unrelated classes or functions in the same file. For very simple, single-purpose scripts, a single `main.py` is acceptable, but this should be the exception, not the rule.

    3.  **DEFINE THE MAIN ENTRY POINT:** The primary executable script MUST be named `main.py`. It should act as the entry point, initializing and orchestrating the other components.

    4.  **PLAN FOR DEPENDENCIES:**
        *   Identify all necessary `pip` installable dependencies.
        *   If your plan requires dependencies, you MUST also plan for a `requirements.txt` file. Its purpose should be: "Lists all project dependencies."

    {JSON_OUTPUT_RULE}

    **GENERIC EXAMPLE OF A CORRECT, MODULAR RESPONSE:**
    ```json
    {{{{
      "files": [
        {{{{
          "filename": "config.py",
          "purpose": "Handles loading API keys and other configuration from environment variables."
        }}}},
        {{{{
          "filename": "services/api_client.py",
          "purpose": "Contains the logic for making API calls to an external service."
        }}}},
        {{{{
          "filename": "main.py",
          "purpose": "Main entry point. Handles user input, uses the API client to fetch data, and prints the result."
        }}}},
        {{{{
          "filename": "requirements.txt",
          "purpose": "Lists all project dependencies."
        }}}}
      ],
      "dependencies": ["requests", "python-dotenv"]
    }}}}
    ```

    Now, design the application structure for the user's request.

MODIFICATION_PLANNER_PROMPT = textwrap.dedent(f"""
    You are an expert senior software developer specializing in modifying existing Python codebases. Your primary directive is to respect and extend the existing architecture.

    **USER'S MODIFICATION REQUEST:** "{{prompt}}"

    ---
    **CONTEXT ON EXISTING PROJECT (FULL SOURCE CODE):**
    ```json
    {{full_code_context}}
    ```
    ---

    **MODIFICATION DIRECTIVES (UNBREAKABLE LAWS):**
    1.  **RESPECT EXISTING PATTERNS:** Your plan MUST conform to the patterns and libraries already used in the project. Do NOT introduce new, incompatible libraries or architectural patterns.
    2.  **USE EXISTING FILE PATHS:** When planning to modify a file, you MUST use its exact existing path.
    3.  **CREATE NEW FILES LOGICALLY:** If new files are required, their path and purpose must align with the existing project structure.
    4.  **CONCISE PURPOSE:** For each file in your plan, write a clear, one-sentence "purpose" explaining the high-level goal of the changes.
    5.  **OUTPUT FORMAT:** Your response MUST be ONLY a valid JSON object with a single key "files". The value should be a list of file objects.

    **EXAMPLE OF CORRECT MODIFICATION PLAN OUTPUT:**
    ```json
    {{{{
        "files": [
            {{{{
                "filename": "utils/api_client.py",
                "purpose": "Add a new method for handling POST requests."
            }}}},
            {{{{
                "filename": "main.py",
                "purpose": "Update the main function to use the new POST request method."
            }}}}
        ]
    }}}}
