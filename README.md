# Avakin: Your AI Partner for Planning, Building, and Modifying Code.

Tired of wrestling with vague prompts and getting code that doesn't match your vision? Avakin is a complete, local-first AI development environment that understands that great software starts with a great plan. It introduces a unique two-phase workflow: a creative **Plan** mode and a technical **Build** mode, letting you go from a simple idea to a complete, multi-file application with unparalleled precision.

Stop trying to write the perfect prompt. Instead, have a conversation.

## The Avakin Workflow: Plan, then Build

Avakin splits the development process into two distinct, powerful phases.

### **Phase 1: Plan with Aura (Your Creative Partner)** üé®
Toggle into **Plan Mode** and chat with Aura, your creative AI assistant. Don't worry about technical jargon. Just talk about your idea. Aura will:
- **Ask clarifying questions** to understand your core goals.
- **Brainstorm features** and suggest technical approaches.
- **Analyze images or diagrams** you provide for context.
- **Collaboratively produce a detailed technical blueprint** for the AI coding team.

### **Phase 2: Build with Precision (The AI Engineering Team)** üõ†Ô∏è
Once you're happy with the plan, toggle into **Build Mode**. Avakin's team of specialized AI agents (Architect, Coder, Reviewer) takes over, turning the blueprint into reality. This team will:
- **Scaffold an entire multi-file application** based on the blueprint.
- **Surgically modify existing codebases** with pinpoint accuracy.
- **Intelligently debug errors** with a single click, understanding the full project context.

This unique workflow ensures the final code is not just functional, but a true reflection of your refined vision.

## Core Features

‚ö°Ô∏è **Intelligent Development Cycle:**
   - **Project Scaffolding:** Go from a single sentence to a complete, runnable, multi-file project in seconds.
   - **Surgical Code Modification:** Make complex, context-aware changes to existing codebases using natural language.
   - **One-Click Debugging:** When your code fails, a "Review & Fix" button appears. Avakin analyzes the full project context, git history, and error traceback to provide a precise, intelligent fix.

üß† **Deep Project Understanding (Dual-Context RAG):**
   - **Project-Specific Knowledge:** Feed Avakin your project's GDD, specific documentation, or existing files to give it deep, contextual understanding *for that project*. Each project gets its own isolated knowledge base.
   - **Global Knowledge Base:** Augment Avakin with a separate, global library of code examples, best practices, or any text-based knowledge to enhance its general expertise (path configured via `GLOBAL_RAG_DB_PATH` in your `.env` file).

üîå **Powered by Your Choice of LLMs (Local First):**
   - **Full Local Control with Ollama:** Run powerful open-source models (like Llama 3, Mistral, CodeLlama) directly on your machine using [Ollama](https://ollama.com/). Avakin automatically discovers and integrates with your running Ollama instance.
   - **Cloud Model Integration:** Seamlessly connect to your OpenAI, Google Gemini, and Anthropic API keys.
   - **Customizable AI Team:** Configure which LLM (local or cloud) you want for each role. Use a massive model for architecture and a fast, cheap model for chat. You are in control.

üîê **100% Local & Private:**
   - When using Ollama, your code, your prompts, and your knowledge bases never leave your machine.

üîå **Extensible Plugin System:**
   - Avakin is built on a robust plugin architecture. Extend its capabilities, add new agents, or integrate with other tools. (More example plugins are on the way!)

## Why Avakin Exists

I built Avakin out of necessity. After a decade of teaching myself to code, I wanted something I could use in my everyday workflow‚Äîsomething that didn't cost a subscription on top of expensive API calls. With Avakin, I can build clients efficient, secure, and robust applications in a fraction of the time it would take with traditional methods.

## Getting Started (Running from Source)

Avakin is designed to be run directly from source, giving you full control.

**Prerequisites:**
*   Python 3.10 or newer.
*   Git.
*   **(Strongly Recommended for Local LLMs)** [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) installed and running.
*   Download your desired models (e.g., `ollama pull llama3`).

**1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
    git clone https://github.com/carpsesdema/AvA_Kintsugi.git
    cd AvA_Kintsugi
```
**2. Install Dependencies**
* It's highly recommended to use a Python virtual environment.
```bash
* # Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
    python -m venv .venv
    # On Windows:
    .venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    # source .venv/bin/activate
       
    # Install the required packages
    pip install -r src/ava/requirements.txt
   ```

**3. Configure API Keys & RAG (Optional but Recommended):**
Create a file named .env in the root of the AvA_Kintsugi project directory.
Add your API keys if you plan to use cloud models:
```bash
# .env file content
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
GEMINI_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key"
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."

# For the Global RAG Database (Optional but Recommended for full power)
# Path to a directory where your global knowledge base (e.g., code examples)
# will be stored. Create this directory if it doesn't exist.
GLOBAL_RAG_DB_PATH="C:/YourKnowledgeBases/AvakinGlobalRAG" 
# Example for Linux/macOS: GLOBAL_RAG_DB_PATH="/Users/yourname/AvakinGlobalRAG"
```
* If you don't create a .env file or add cloud API keys, Avakin will rely solely on your local Ollama models.
* If GLOBAL_RAG_DB_PATH is not set, the global RAG features will be less effective.

**4. Launch!**
*Run the main application script from the root directory of the project:
```bash
  python -m src/ava/main.py
```

You're ready to go! Configure your desired models in Avakin's "Configure AI Models" dialog.
